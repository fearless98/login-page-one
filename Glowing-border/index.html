            <h1>Glowing Border</h1>
            <p>When the rain is blowing in your face, And the whole world is on your case. I could offer you a warm embrace, To make you feel my love. When the evening shadows and the stars appear, And there is no one there to dry your tears. Oh, I hold
                you for a million years, To make you feel my love.</p>
